batch script updating the version control, copying all files into one directory and pack it into .pak files

## CreateBuild.bat
As the script isn't polished until now, but I wanted to release it as early as possible there can be bugs.
For better understanding I will publish my folder structure:

|-MainFolder (doesn't matter)

    |-BuildArchive
  
    |-BuildScripts (i got more than one - put the scripts in here [CreateBuild.bat] etc.)
  
    |-SVN (that's for our clean repository - get's updated using the script)
  
      |-yourprojectname
